<b>Week Counter</b>, the new iOS/iPhone app that lets you see the date a certain number of weeks away from today, has just been submitted to Apple for Beta Testing Approval. <!--more-->

####Tell me about Week Counter
Ever wondered what the date is six weeks from today? Some professions need this information all of the time. For example, doctors want to make an appointment with their patient four weeks from today. Instead of pulling out the calendar and counting, simply pull out the Week Counter app and let it do the difficult work.

Future plans include an Apple Watch integration, so those who use this information all the time will have quick, wrist access to the date several weeks in the future.

####How can I download it?
As soon as Week Counter is approved by Apple for Beta Testing, I can begin to invite beta test users. If you would like to participate, please [contact me](/contact/) and write your email address in the contact form.
